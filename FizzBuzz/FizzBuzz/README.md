## FizzBuzz problem
This is one of the common interview questions. I was actually asked thsi recently and was able to get it but lost my thought a little bit during nervousness. 

In the variation I was asked, given number from 1 to 100, print **Fizz** if the number is divisible by 2 and **Buzz** if divisible by 3. 
Print **FizzBuzz** if divisible by both numbers and print the number itself if it is not divisible by either 2 or 3.

It was interesting problem and apparently a very common interview white boarding problem. 
Something to know if you do not already.
